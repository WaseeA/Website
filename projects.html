    <h1>Java: Banking Project</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>This project aims to emulate a banking system through Java.</li>
        <li>I've learned about Object Oriented Programming.</li>
        <li>I've learned about graphs in Java.</li>
        <li>I've learned the Java swing library.</li>
        <li>I've learned the OpenCSV library.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Python: L.S.B.U. Hackathon</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Here participants were tasked with creating or innovating a solution to problems stemming from COVID-19.</li>
        <li>We opted to create a COVID-19 Vaccination system in Python.</li>
        <li>We used object oriented programming and many libraries.</li>
        <li>The most notable libraries include: Pandas, Tkinter and plotly.</li>
        <li>This app had a simplistic GUI which showcased current vaccination trends, and compared it to vaccination trends after our algorithm was applied.</li>
        <li>To scrape current trends we used existing data from reputable sources such as the WHO and government organizations.</li>
        <li>We've also improved our presentation skills and showcased our app in the video, found on the GitHub repository.</li>
        </ul>

    <h1>Python/Anaconda: QR Code Database</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>This project aims to create a database for the inventory of items and attendance of events from people.</li>
        <li>My role was aggregating and storing unstructured data from Excel files.</li>
        <li>I used dataclasses and some semi modular functions to accomplish this task.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>C: RSA Encrytion</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>After learning about the importance of privacy my friend and I wanted to create an encryption service.</li>
        <li>This project takes in sentences and encrypts them using the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman algorthim.</li>
        <li>Here we learned about new at the time concepts such as pointers and learned the C programming language.</li>
        <li>We utilized global variables and many built in libraries.</li>
    </ul>
